# BlogReader
This is a simple Blog Reading application, that connects you to teamtreehouse blog.
It shows the posts in a list format by downloading and parsing JSON data, you can access them either in the application or you can open it in a web browser if click on some external link.

Update: Bug Removed - sometimes the blog wouldn't load, each time the error would pop up, now the application would try reloading automatically if the blog doesn't load, unless there is no network connection.
